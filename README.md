## Project Overview
The access to vaccination sites indicator examines the spatial dimensions of public health equity, exploring whether income influences the accessibility of immunization services. This analysis compares the spatial distribution of vaccination sites with median household income across Calgary’s Community Service Areas (CSAs) to identify potential disparities in the availability of services. Namely, this indicator seeks to answer the question: To what extent does household income affect access to immunization within Calgary?

## Folder Structure

Within the main folder are three subfolders: Data, Documents, and Output_Figures.

- **Data/**
  - **Raw_Data/** – Contains all unedited raw data directly from the source.
  - **Processed_Data/** – Includes edited intermediate and final data, metadata, and schemas.
    - **FinalCompositeFile** – The final analysis table containing median income, vaccination sites, nearest distance, and all calculated fields.  
      A secondary sheet includes results from an *ANOVA: Single Factor* analysis.

- **Documents/**
  - Contains the written report titled *“WrittenReport_Accessibility_of_Immunization”*, including results and findings.  
  - Citations, references, and license information can be found in Section 9 of this report.

- **Output_Figures/**
  - **Graphs/** – Holds output scatterplots and boxplots.
  - **Maps/** – Contains map layout outputs.

## CRS and Data Format

- Processed data: **CSV files**  
- Raw data: **Shapefiles**  
- All data projected using **NAD 1983 CSRS UTM Zone 11N**  
- The CEI (Calgary Equity Index) is completed over Community Service Areas — a custom geography formed by combining two adjacent census tracts to reach approximately 10,000 people.

## Data Sources

- **Vaccination Locations:** Calgary Open Data Portal (data provided by Blue Cross), accessed *October 16, 2025*  
- **Median Income:** Calgary Open Data Portal (data provided by Calgary Equity Index Overlay Statistics), accessed *October 16, 2025*  
- **2021 Federal Population and Dwelling Count by Community:** Statistics Canada, accessed *October 17, 2025*

## Methods Summary

This analysis was completed using **ArcGIS Pro** and **Excel** with a modified proximity-based approach.

- 1 km buffer zones were created around each immunization site.  
- Population counts were calculated per catchment under the assumption of uniform population distribution using Euclidean distance.  
- Accessibility scores were defined as the number of vaccination sites available per 1,000 individuals.  
- An **ANOVA: Single Factor** analysis tested whether there was a statistically significant relationship between median income and spatial access.

 Detailed methodology is available in **Section 4** of *“WrittenReport_Accessibility_of_Immunization”* - in the Documents folder.
